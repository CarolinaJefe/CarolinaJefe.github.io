            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>The website will include dynamic headers and footers. Additionally, the usage of an API for gathering member data for the members webpage is in mind. Something like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-modern-javascript-methods-by-building-football-team-cards/step-47" target="_blank">this</a>. Retrieving JSON data from a database or JavaScript Fetch API shouldn't be too difficult. If time doesn't permit, static information will be adopted.</p>
