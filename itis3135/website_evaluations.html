                <h3><a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">MEDIUM</a></h3>
                <p>Medium's website serves as a platform for human stories and ideas, encouraging individuals to share insightful perspectives, valuable knowledge, and life wisdom with the world. This is an example of a GOOD website.</p>

                <div class="list-container2">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C:</b> There is a fine distinction in the semantics of the HTML page. Simplicity is in effect, with colors signaling different sections of the page.</li>
                        <li><b>R:</b> Articles are organized within columns and remain consistent across other webpages. Font style is identical, and sizing is appropriate.</li>
                        <li><b>A:</b> The usage of columns maintains page alignment, and window resizing has no effect on the webpage display.</li>
                        <li><b>P:</b> The content is evenly spaced with sufficient margins, making it difficult to misinterpret the distinction between sections.</li>

                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">YALE SCHOOL Â­OF ART</a></h3>
                <p>Yale's website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing. This is an example of a BAD website.</p>

                <div class="list-container2">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C:</b> While there is an appealing contrast, some text proves challenging to read due to an excessive use of colors. This inconsistency in color choices can contribute to a lack of clarity and readability.</li>
                        <li><b>R:</b> Font style shows repetition, yet visual elements are dispersed with arbitrary colors and sizing. This lack of cohesion in color choices and font sizing can result in a poor visual hierarchy.</li>
                        <li><b>A:</b> Elements are organized in columns; however, there are instances where these columns have odd directions and disparities. There is hardly ever a visual connection with other elements.</li>
                        <li><b>P:</b> It is challenging to determine which elements are grouped together, as there is not a sufficient amount of spacing, and they do not communicate effectively.</li>
                    </ul>
