            <p>Greetings, I'm Ariel Vera, an individual born in the town of Ridgewood, New Jersey, but my heart and roots are firmly embedded in Charlotte, North Carolina, where I was raised. On my webpages, you'll gain insight into how I successfully meet specific criteria outlined in assignments. Have a look around and feel free to take inspiration from my accomplished work.</p>
